## Deploy the smart contract

The easiest way to deploy the smart contract is to go to https://ide.wavesplatform.com, choose the network you want use (upper right settings icon, testnet by default), create a new account (upper right "add account")

**You needs to load your account with waves token:**

For testnet got to the faucet: [https://wavesexplorer.com/testnet/faucet](https://wavesexplorer.com/testnet/faucet) &nbsp;For mainnet you can get at: https://www.waves.exchange 

Now create a new dApp script (bottom left + sign) and copy / paste the code from ./ride/covid.ride from this repo.

Then deploy ether by clicking deploy (bottom right) or typing deploy() in the console.

The address of this dApp account is the address to put in settings.js > this.dappAddress\

## Start the web app

Simply run the command:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

## Using the web app

```Got to localhost:3000/admin```

Click on **START**

If you dont have any Waves account yet, you will have to define a password and click sign up

You are now connected with your new account with the address displayed on top, copy it and past it in the settings.js as this.userAddress

You can now configure the page and start add entries (make sure to have some waves on this account too)

You can acces your page at localhost:3000
